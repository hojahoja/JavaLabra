The classic Mine Sweeper Game:

The Idea is to click the buttons seen in the game and see what is revealed underneath.
A number will tell how many adjacent mines the cell you clicked has.
You can try deduce how which cells are mined from all the numbers you have possibly revealed.

Click the suspected cell with the right mouse button to flag it.
If all the correct Cells are flagged and all the other cells are opened, you win the game.
If you were fast enough can record your high score.

If you click a cell that has a mine and you have not flagged it, you lose.

If the cell has as many flagged cells as the number it shows you, click on the number to open all
the adjacent cells of that particular cell. If the correct cells were flagged you have just opened multiple
cells in quick succession. If the wrong cell was flagged, you just opened multiple cells including the one
with a mine.

This allows for very fast games, but you also have to be more careful.

Scores
------

The game will record the time it took you to finish it and it will check if was
faster than any of the current scores. If it was your name will be asked and you can
type whatever you wish.

Only The preset game modes: Easy, Medium and Hard will save scores.

Custom Game Mode
----------------

There is alson an option to create a game field with customized parameters
The limits of your options are written on the window that allows you to change
the game settings. If you enter a value that is not inside the specified range
the game will default that value to the same setting it is in Easy mode.
